function n21 = norm_l21(x, g_d,g_t, w2,w1)
%NORM_L21 L21 mixed norm
%   Usage:  n21 = norm_l21(x);
%           n21 = norm_l21(x, g_d,g_t);
%           n21 = norm_l21(x, g_d,g_t, w2,w1);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         x     : Input data 
%         g_d   : group vector 1
%         g_t   : group vector 2
%         w2    : weights for the two norm (default 1)
%         w1    : weights for the one norm (default 1)
%   Output parameters:
%         y     : Norm
%
%   NORM_L21(x, g_d,g_t, w2,w1) returns the norm L21 of x. If x is a
%   matrix the 2 norm will be computed as follow:
%
%       n21 = || x ||_21 = sum_j ( sum_i |x(i,j)|^2 )^(1/2) 
%
%   In this case, all other argument are not necessary.
%
%   'norm_l21(x)' with x a row vector is equivalent to norm(x,1) and
%   'norm_l21(x)' with x a line vector is equivalent to norm(x)
%
%   For fancy group, please provide the groups vectors.
%
%   g_d, g_t are the group vectors. g_d contain the indices of the
%   element to be group and g_t the size of different groups.
%       
%   Example: 
%                x=[x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 x6] 
%                Group 1: [x1 x2 x4 x5] 
%                Group 2: [x3 x6]
%
%   Leads to 
%           
%               => g_d=[1 2 4 5 3 6] and g_t=[4 2]
%               Or this is also possible
%               => g_d=[4 5 3 6 1 2] and g_t=[2 4]   
%
%   This function works also for overlapping groups.
