function [ Kw, ny, Mg, zo,wo] = find_mg( z,lambda,w )
%FIND_MG find the MG other stuff for the prox_l12
%
%   In the litterature, they are mistakes in the formulas. As consquence,
%   this function is a mixed of the formulas found in those 3 papers. In the
%   first paper, the formulas seems correct. The easier to read is most
%   likely the third one.
